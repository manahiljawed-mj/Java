    git clone https://github.com/manahiljawed-mj/Java.git
   ```
   ```
    cd Java/Basic_Java_Codes/Codes
   ```
   ***or***
   ```
   cd Java/OOP_With_Java/Codes
   ```
   ***or***
   ```
   cd Java/Data_Structures_With_Java/Codes
   ```
   ***or***
   ```
   cd Java/Java_Projects/Codes
   ```
   
3. **Compile Java files (if necessary):**
- If you need to compile `.java` files to `.class` files, use `javac`:
  ```
  javac filename.java
  ```
  Replace `filename.java` with the Java file you want to compile.

3. **Run the programs:**
- Run the Java programs using the `java` command:
  ```
  java main_method_class_name
  ```
  Replace `main_method_class_name` with the appropriate class name containing the main method.

- For example, to run the `Hello_World` program:
  ```
  java Hello_World
  ```
